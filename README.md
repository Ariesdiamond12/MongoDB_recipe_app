# Recipe App

- I've created a simple recipe app that allows users to view a list of recipes, add new recipes, and delete existing
- I've used mongoose, express, and node.js to create the backend of the app
- I've defined a Recipe model using mongoose to store recipe data in a MongoDB database
- I've created routes for GET, POST, and DELETE requests to interact with the Recipe model
- I've used express to handle requests and send responses back to the client
